description: Use a user-provided folder of samples and MIDI files in the song. Scans the folder, catalogs audio (one-shots, loops, risers, vocal chops) vs MIDI clips, then places audio on the timeline with reaper_insert_media, routes drum one-shots into a sampler for MIDI triggering, and imports .mid files as clips. Load whenever the user points at a folder of their own sounds ("use the samples in C:\...", "there's MIDI in this folder").

# Using a local folder of samples / MIDI

When the user points at a folder, you can pull their own sounds into the song. You have two
capabilities here:

- **Read the folder** with your normal filesystem tools (`Glob`, `Read`) — the project runs on
  the same machine as Reaper, so a path the user gives you is readable by both.
- **Place files** with `reaper_insert_media(track_index, file_path, start_sec)` — imports an
  audio file as an audio item, or a `.mid` file as a MIDI clip, at a chosen time. Pass an
  **absolute path**.

## Step 1 — scan and catalog

1. Confirm the absolute folder path with the user.
2. `Glob` for the relevant types: audio (`**/*.{wav,aiff,aif,flac,mp3,ogg}`) and MIDI
   (`**/*.{mid,midi}`).
3. Classify each file from its **name** (and subfolder) into roles — this is heuristic but
   usually reliable:
   - drums/one-shots: `kick`, `snare`, `clap`, `hat`/`hh`, `808`, `tom`, `crash`, `ride`, `perc`
   - loops: `loop`, `groove`, `beat`, `drumloop` (often tagged with BPM, e.g. `_128_`)
   - tonal: `bass`, `chord`, `melody`, `lead`, `pluck`, `pad`, `key`
   - transitions/fx: `riser`, `uplifter`, `downlifter`, `impact`, `boom`, `sweep`, `fx`
   - vocals: `vox`, `vocal`, `chop`, `acapella`, `phrase`
   - MIDI: `.mid` files — chord progressions, melodies, drum patterns, basslines
4. Note any **BPM** (`120`, `_128_`, `140bpm`) and **key** (`Cmin`, `F#`, `Amaj`) tags in
   filenames — they tell you what fits the project tempo/key.
5. Present a short catalog and ask how to use it (or map it to the arrangement yourself and
   confirm). Don't silently dump everything in.

## Step 2 — use the files

### Audio loops (drum loops, melodic loops)
Place at the start second of each section they belong to: `reaper_insert_media(track, path,
section_start_sec)`. Use the `music-theory` bar grid so the loop lands on the downbeat.
- **Tempo caveat:** Reaper does NOT time-stretch an inserted loop to the project tempo unless
  the item is set to stretch. If a loop's tagged BPM differs from the project tempo, warn the
  user it may not line up, and prefer loops matching (or close to) the project BPM. Honest is
  better than silently-out-of-time.

### Drum / instrument one-shots → drop on the timeline (default)
By default, build the part by placing one-shots **directly as audio items at each hit**. Work
out the pattern from the genre skill + the `music-theory` bar grid, then for every hit call
`reaper_insert_media(track, oneshot_path, hit_sec)`. Put each drum voice (kick/snare/hat/perc)
on its own track so it can be mixed and edited separately.

**Only route into a sampler if the user explicitly asks for it** (e.g. they want to play/edit
drums as MIDI). Then: set up a Sitala track (see `recommended-vsts`), tell them which one-shots
to drag onto which pads — the MCP can't load files into a sampler's pads automatically (no
file-path parameter) — and trigger with `add_midi_notes`. Don't default to this; it adds a
manual mapping step the timeline approach avoids.

> **Record the pad→drum assignment you tell them to set up.** Because *you* decide which one-shot
> goes on which pad, you know the exact trigger note (Sitala pads run chromatically from MIDI 36 —
> pad 1 = 36, pad 2 = 37, …; that fixed layout lives in `drum-maps/Sitala.json`). Which *drum* is
> on each pad is **song-specific**, so put that assignment in the **track map** (and song-state) as
> `verified: true` — e.g. `{"36":"kick","37":"snare","38":"clap","42":"closed hat","46":"open
> hat"}` — and hand it to the composer, rather than overwriting the shared kit file. This is the
> one case where the drum mapping is exactly known by construction — don't waste it.

### One-off audio (risers, impacts, vocal chops, FX)
Drop directly as audio items with `reaper_insert_media` at the exact moment they hit (e.g. a
riser across the last bars of a build, an impact on a drop's downbeat).

### MIDI files (.mid)
- **Preserve a performance:** `reaper_insert_media(track, path, section_start_sec)` imports the
  `.mid` as a MIDI clip intact on an instrument track — best when the user wants *that* exact
  part. Make sure the track already has an instrument loaded (via `vst-setup`).
- **Adapt it instead:** if they want it transposed/retimed/reworked, `Read` the catalog context,
  decide the changes, and write fresh notes with `reaper_add_midi_notes` (using `music-theory`
  for transposition) rather than importing.

## Step 3 — report
Tell the user exactly what you placed where (file → track → section/time), what you routed to a
sampler for them to map, and flag anything skipped (wrong BPM, unsupported format, ambiguous).

This folder is a *source of material*, not a replacement for the arrangement — fit the user's
sounds into the plan from the `arranger`, don't let a pile of samples dictate the song.
